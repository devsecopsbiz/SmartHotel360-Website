# SmartHotel360

We are happy to announce the release of SmartHotel360. This release intends to share a simplified version of SmartHotel360 reference sample apps used at Connect(); 2017 Keynotes. If you missed it, you can watch <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2017/K100">Scott Guthrieâ€™s Keynote: Journey to the Intelligent Cloud in Channel 9</a>.

We updated the code for this repository to support Scott Hanselman's General Session from Ignite 2018, [An end-to-end tour of the Microsoft developer platform](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/66696#ignite-html-anchor). 

# SmartHotel360 Repos

# SmartHotel360 - Website
Welcome to the repository containing the website of SmartHotel360. SmartHotel360 has multiple apps that share a common backend, including a public website where hotel guests can book a room, smart conference rooms, and even include their accompanying family travelers and their pets! The site was built using ASP.NET Core. 

# Getting Started

Once downloaded you can open the `SmartHotel360.WebSite.sln` file, located in the Source folder to open the solution in Visual Studio 2017 15.5 or higher. This solution contains three projects:

* The SmartHotel360.Website project: An [ASP.NET Core](www.dot.net) website which is a web app developed using React+Redux and server-side rendering.
* The SmartHotel360.WebsiteFunction project: An Azure Function used to analyze photos of pets using the Cognitive Services Vision API and Azure Cosmos DB.
* The SmartHotel360.WebsiteARM project: An Azure Resource Manager template to facilitate the deployment of the different resources you may need in order to deploy the app in your Azure subscription.

# Deploy to Azure

We have added an ARM template so you can automate the creation of the resources

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FSmartHotel360-Website%2Fmaster%2FSource%2FSmartHotel360.WebsiteARM%2Fsmarthote360.website.deployment.json?target=_blank" target='_blank'><img src="/Documents/Images/deploy-to-azure.png" alt="Deploy to Azure"/></a>

## Running The Website

Set `SmartHotel360.Website` as startup project, then hit F5 to start debugging. The web is configured to use the public endpoints for the backend, so you don't need to run the backend locally. 

## Configuring The Website

The file `appsettings.Development.json` contains the settings of the website. By default, the following options are used:

* `SettingsUrl`: Url of the configuration endpoint. By default, it uses the public endpoint service. Only change if you are running your own backend services.
* `FakeAuth`: Contains data to "simulate" the login process. Data is `Name` (name of the user), `UserId` (id of the user), `PicUrl` (url of the user avatar).

> If `FakeAuth` is **not set** the Website site uses an Azure Active Directory B2C to enable the logins. Please read "[Enabling B2C logins](Documents/B2C.md)" if you want to use B2C logins.

If you want to deploy this application to your own Azure subscription, see [this setup guide](Documents/AzureDeployment.md) for instructions. 

# Running the Pet Checker Azure Function

You can [run the Azure Function locally or deploy it to Azure](Documents/AzureFunction.md)

# Demo Scripts
There is a detailed step-by-step demo script in the [demoscripts](Documents/DemoScripts) folder of this repo that you can use in your own presentations. In order to perform the demos, you will need to deploy the application resources to Azure first.
